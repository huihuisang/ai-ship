Nix is a package manager built on the “purely functional” philosophy. It makes every dependency explicit, keeps every build reproducible, and stops environments from polluting each other. Even better, declarative configuration lets you sync system environments, development tools, and user-level software across multiple machines, truly achieving “write once, consistent everywhere.”

I used to rely on [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) to keep configurations in sync, but it has been heavily restricted on newer systems and even loses configs outright. That pushed me to reassess how quickly I should prioritize Nix. The syntax and onboarding curve were what held me back from a full migration before, yet now the situation has changed: I can describe what I need in natural language and have AI write the `nix` configuration—or even the entire flake—for me, virtually eliminating the learning curve.

Combined with Nix’s deterministic nature, switching devices, reinstalling a system, or moving my environment somewhere else comes down to a single idea: **copy and done**.

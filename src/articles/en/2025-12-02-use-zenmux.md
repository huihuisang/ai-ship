After getting burned yet again when the money I prepaid to Anthropic [expired before I could finish it](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1jnunxu/do_not_add_a_lot_of_money_to_api_account/), I decided to shift all my API usage from “depositing directly with model vendors” to “using model aggregation platforms.” I already had an account with [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) and had used it lightly, but OR offers far too many messy models, and the provider settings are complicated—if you’re not careful, traffic can flow to niche providers and cause unexpected headaches. By comparison, ZenMux’s interface is cleaner, its model list is clearly curated, and the suppliers appear to be only the official ones. I expect to focus on it for a while.

The visit button points to my referral link; `new users get an extra 25% bonus on their first deposit`. The value is solid, so I recommend giving it a try.
